## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the gatsby-starter-typescript
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-typescript-basic https://github.com/MateusSoares895/gatsby-starter-typescript-basic
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    # enter in folder
    cd gatsby-starter-typescript-basic
    # open in editor
    code .
    # run development server
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

    Open the `gatsby-starter-typescript` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc.json
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package-lock.json or yarn.lock
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json

3.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

4.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5.  **`.eslintrc.json`**: This file is the configuration of ESLint. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

6.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

7.  **`.prettierignore`**: This file tells Prettier which files it should not format for.

8.  **`.prettierrc.json`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby's starter with TypeScript is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

11. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

12) **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13) **`package-lock.json`** or **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your node dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

14) **`tsconfig.json`**: The presence of this file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. This file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.
